# Solidity-Smart-Contract-Deployment-Demo
This repository provides a basic demonstration of deploying a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
### Project Structure

- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contract files.
- **scripts/**: Includes deployment scripts.
- **test/**: Contains test scripts for verifying contract functionality.
- **README.md**: Provides instructions and documentation.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Truffle**: Install Truffle globally using npm:

    ```
    npm install -g truffle

    cd solidity-smart-contract-deployment
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile Contracts:**

    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

4. **Deploy Contracts:**

    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network <network-name>
    ```
